"This plugin will remove the version information that gets appended to "
"enqueued style and script URLs. It will also remove the Meta Generator in "
"the head and in RSS feeds. Adds a bit of obfuscation to hide the WordPress "
"version number and generator tag that many sniffers detect automatically "
"from view source. But always remember to keep your WordPress updated."
